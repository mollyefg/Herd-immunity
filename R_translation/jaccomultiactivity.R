jaccomultiactivity<-function(pactivity, activitypi){
#This program calculates, for the model with different activity levels,
#the infection contact rate matrix Lambda
#(this is the matrix A in the supplementary information) and the vector
#vecpi giving the fractions of the population in different age groups 
#from the data in Wallinga et al (2006).  pactivity is a vector containing
#the different activity levels and activitypi is a vecctor containing
#the fractions of the population having the different activity levels.
#If the age types are denoted by 
#(A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6) and the activity types by (L, M, H) then the 18
#types in e.g. vecpi are ordered 
#(A1L, A1M, A1H, A2L, A2M, A2H,..., A6L, A6M, A6H).
